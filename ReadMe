Surprise Housing Assignment

Case Study on Surprise Housing:
Surprise Housing,a US-based housing company has decided to enter the Australian market.
The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a low market value and sell them at a higher price.
For this purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia and saved under train.csv.

The company is looking at such low value properties to buy to enter the market.
We need to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

Objective:
Model the price of houses with the available independent variables. 
This model will be used by Surprise Housing management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables.
They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns.
Further, the model will be a good way to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market for management.

Approach followed:
Using Advance Regression Model (Ridge and Lasso) to predict this price of houses with the available independent variables.
